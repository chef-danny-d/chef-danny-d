# Hi, I'm Dániel Bence Papp! 👋


## 🚀 About Me
I'm an experienced Front-End Developer with a demonstrated history of 
working in the Software Engineering field both professionally and on a 
contract basis. Skilled in UI Development, WordPress Web Development, and UI Design. 
I'm studying at Old Dominion University, for a **M.S. Computer Science** degree. My 
undergraduate degree is **B.B.A Information Systems and Decision Science** with a double minor in
